Hello fellow earthling! I'm a software engineer, designer and entrepreneur from
Helsinki, Finland. I enjoy solving problems and creating things that people
love. I also think software can be used to make the world more a more equal place, tackle
challenges facing the environment and reach for the stars and beyond! Be good and
dream big!
