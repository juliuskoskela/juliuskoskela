# Julius Koskela

Helsinki, Finland. I enjoy solving problems and creating things that people
love. I also think software can be used to make the world more a more equal place, tackle
challenges facing the environment and reach for the stars and beyond! Be good and
dream big!

## Interests

-	Music, production and playing the guitar. I hope to combine my love for
	making music with programming in the future and am interested in
	opportunities under this topic! [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/exploringforlife)

-	Nature, hiking and photography. I spend most of my summers up north in the
	Finnish Lapland. Can we make software that helps fight climate change? [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/exploringforlife/)
	
-	Inequality, justice and open source. Can we build a more equal and humane space
	online and offline? Can we harness data in an open and trustworthy matter
	feeding algorithms that try to help people rather than abuse them?

-	Value driven business. Can we build companies that have a greater motivation
	other than maximizing sharholder value?
